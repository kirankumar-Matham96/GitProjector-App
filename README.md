# Git Projector

A MERN-stack app that represents git hub and has some of the features that github provides, along with some new features.

## Main Features
  - User can search for their repositories and filter the results.
  - Can view any repository details.
  - Can book mark the repositories to user account.
  - Can Download the repository data in PDF format.
  - And many more features are coming in the future...

## NOTE: 
The app is in development phase. You can check the code progress in the respective branches (frontend and backend).
For cloning the repo, you need to clone frntend and backend branches separately for now. Once I feel the app is working enough to be deployed, I will merge the branches to master branch.

Thank you for visiting Git Projector!
